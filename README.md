# Basic Portfolio

This small project was no small feat. Being my first class homework assignment in HTML/CSS at UC Berkeley Extension, I encountered many issues that i did not anticipate.

The greatest struggle for this portfolio was the positioning both of/in the Header and the center Sections of each page (along with all of their content). Manipulating different elements within the space proved to be the greatest challenge as I didn't quote grasp the concepts of float, position: static, position: absolute or position: relative. I'd move one element only to find that others had either moved along with it or disappeared behind it. It was quite a challenge. Fortunately, with a great deal of practice, lessons from the course instructor and some helpful tips from a classmate, I mannaged to piece everything together to my liking. I can safely say that i'm a lot more comfortable with HTML/CSS right meow.

## Acknowledgments

* I would definitely like to acknowledge Dexter Valencia who helped me out a lot specifically with the 3rd page (Contacts). He showed me quite a few useful methods of approach and, working with him on in-class activities, we both learned a great deal more on css positioning.
* I would also like to achnowledge the class instructor Jerome Chenette, as none of this would have been possible without his lessons, guidence and support.
